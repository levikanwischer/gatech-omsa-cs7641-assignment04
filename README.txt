CS 7641 - Machine Learning - Fall 2018 (Markov Decision Processes)
------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview
This repo contains all code used for the Markov Decision Processes assignment as part of the Fall 2018 CS7641 course at Georgia Tech. Code for this assignment can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/levikanwischer/gatech-omsa-cs7641-assignment04. Below are instructions about how to run the code needed to replicate portions this analysis.


## Setup
Code is written in Python 3.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) and uses "pipenv" (https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for reproducibility. All analysis was performed on MacOS Mojave (Intel Core M). Analysis writeup is held separately. To reproduce the analysis, you must install Python 3.7 locally, install any dependencies in the pipenv lock file, then execute each python file (bash$ python FILENAME.py). A "main.py" has been added to allow for executing the bulk of the analysis. Note running these files may take some time to complete.


## Repo
At the top of this repo lives this README, and two folder for code and img. Within the code folder is where the python source code lives, as well as the pipenv files. You will need to "cd" into this folder to activate pipenv and run the analysis. Within the img dir lives outputs from running the analysis. Some of these visuals were used in the final report, but others may have been generated purely for personal analysis.
